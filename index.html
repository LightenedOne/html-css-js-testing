        <summary>Will you work for free/exposure?</summary>
        <p>
            Absolutely <em>not!</em> Art is my full time job and I take it very seriously.
            If you wouldn't work for hours at a time for free, don't expect an artist to do so.

        <summary>Will you draw ____?</summary>
        <p>I have a <a href="#">list</a> of things I will and won't draw. If something isn't on that list,
            there's a good chance I'm willing to draw it.
        </p>
